# TerminalSlides

An application to make presentations with your terminal

# Compile

If you have ncurses just make and you are ready to go.

# Usage

```./slides presentation_file```

This is the first version so the file is very simple:

* % to add text with this format ```x:y:J:text``` where x and y are the percentaje
	of the size of the screen. J is the justification R, L or C.
